# PDF to DOCX Conversion Server

This repository contains the code for a PDF to DOCX (and vice versa) conversion server. The goal is to provide a robust and efficient service for transforming documents between these formats, simplifying file management and interoperability across different applications.

## Planned Features

- **Bidirectional Conversion**: Support for transforming both PDF to DOCX and DOCX to PDF.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: To handle multiple conversion requests without blocking the server.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Mechanisms to manage errors during conversion.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle increasing volumes of requests.
